# Techdegree Project 1
"""README

In this guessing game, a random number will be picked. Your goal is to guess that number in the least amount of guesses.

DIRECTIONS:

1. When the game begins, a number will be picked between 1-10.
2. Input the number you are guessing. (Use numbers, anything else won't add to your "guess ammount.")
3. Keep guessing until you get the correct number.
4. You will be asked if you'd like to play again:
	
	a. "yes" will take you to the beginning again.

	b. "no" ends the game.
5. See your high score at the end of the game!


TO BE ADDED: 
(I felt this README is a little short so I wanted to add some more to it.)

1. Custom Mode:
	-You will be asked if you'd like to create your own range of numbers to guess from. You input the lowest, then the highest.
2. Unique player high scores:
	-When asked to play again, you will input your name. The scores will be kept paired to the appropriate name using a multidimensional list.
	(I didn't add this into the project submission because I feel that it's a little to complex for the game. I will add it on my own for my own personal enjoyment. If I should submit it, let me know!)
